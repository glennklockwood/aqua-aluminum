This page is under construction and currently serves as a dumping ground for
interesting notes on flash memory and other non-volatile RAM technologies.  I
have a set of notes that I would eventually like to post here that explain the
basics of flash-based storage technologies, how they work, and why they have
the limitations that they do.  

I'd also like to discuss emerging technologies like phase-change memory (PCM)
here.  Until I find the time to write up the notes that I've got though, here
are some interesting links:
