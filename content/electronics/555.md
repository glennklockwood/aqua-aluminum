I had a really difficult time understanding exactly what 555 timer circuits do
and how they work.  Most explanations online refer to their functionality when
paired with RC series, but not exactly what logical interactions between the
different input pins are.

To wrap my head around what was going on, I conducted some experiments much like
those I did to [understand how BJT transistors work][bjt transistor page].  I
used

* a Raspberry Pi to control the experiments and log the results
* a TLC555 chip, which came as a part of my [Adafruit Parts Pal][]
* an [MCP41010 digital potentiometer][MCP41010] to vary the input voltages on different 555 pins
* an [MCP3008 analog-to-digital converter][MCP3008] to read the 555's output voltage pin

Given that the 555 timer has four input pins (TRIG, RESET, THRES, and CONT) and
one relevant output pin (OUT), the idea is to hold three of the input pins
fixed, then vary the fourth with the MCP41010 and measure the effect on the OUT
pin with the MCP3008.

## Experimental Setup

The following figure shows my test circuit.

</div>

Of note,

* The MCP3008 ADC is on the rightmost breadboard and the MCP41010 digipot is at
  the top of the leftmost breadboard.
* The TLC555 at the bottom of the left breadboard has long white, green, black,
  and yellow wires that are feed into four ADC channels so we can measure the
  voltage at the TRIG, OUT, RESET, and THRES pins, respectively.
* A single long-ish yellow wire connects the digipot (g5) to the 555 (d14).  We
  move around the d14 end to vary voltage on different 555 input pins.
* All input pins have wires going to the center of the breadboard
  to make it easier to connect these inputs to ground, V<sub>DD</sub>, or the
  digipot output.  These terminate at b16 (RESET), c15 (OUT), and d14 (TRIG)
  above.

The experiments involve subjecting one of the input pins to a triangle wave
controlled by the digipot and measuring the responses on all of the output pins.
It's important to note

1. a full wavelength is used to expose any irreversible behavior
2. between each experiment, any repositioning of connections are done while the
   555's RESET pin is held low.  It is brought high right before the experiment
   is run.

The python script used to control these experiments, as well as the output data
and a Jupyter notebook to generate the following plots, are all in my [555
experimentation GitHub repository][github link].


## The TRIG and THRES pins

We start out by trying to figure out what the TRIG and THRES pins do and how
they are related.  According to the [TLC555 data sheet][], TRIG starts the
"timing input" (whatever that means) and the THRES ends it, so we hold one
constant and vary the other to see what their effects on OUT are.

For now, we'll not worry about the RESET and CONT inputs.  CONT is an analog
control voltage which we can set to V<sub>DD</sub>, and the datasheet says that
OUT will always be low when RESET is low, so let's keep RESET high.  Our test
matrix is then

\# | TRIG     | THRES    | RESET | CONT           |  OUT
---|:--------:|:--------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:
 1 | **vary** | low      |  low  | V<sub>DD</sub> |
 2 | **vary** | high     |  low  | V<sub>DD</sub> |
 3 | low      | **vary** |  low  | V<sub>DD</sub> |
 4 | high     | **vary** |  low  | V<sub>DD</sub> |

By running the experiment by shuffling the TRIG and THRES wires to match the
above experimental conditions, we get the following data:

<div class="shortcode">
{{< figure
    src="tlc555-trig-thres-hysteresis-results.png"
    link="tlc555-trig-thres-hysteresis-results.png"
    alt="555 TRIG and THRES dependency variation over a full high-low-high cycle"
    caption="TRIG and THRES dependency variation over a full high-low-high cycle"
    class="width-100"
    >}}
</div>

From this, it appears that OUT latches high when THRES is low, but OUT is
reversible when THRES is high.  This means that there is some irreversible
behavior happening, and the 555 demonstrates hysteresis when manipulating
the THRES and TRIG pins.

### Examining the Hysteresis

To figure out exactly what sequence of TRIG and THRES changes affect the OUT
pin, I took a step back and tested the TRIG and THRES pins by hand.  I unplugged
the digipot from the 555's inputs and instead attached long orange and white
jumpers to the TRIG and THRES pins, respectively:

<div class="shortcode">
{{< figure
    src="tlc555-experiment-manual.jpg"
    link="tlc555-experiment-manual.jpg"
    alt="555 manual testing circuit"
    caption="555 manual testing circuit"
>}}
</div>

I also added a green LED to show whether OUT was high (on) or low (off).  With
this, I started with TRIG=low and THRES=low, then did the following:

1. Change THRES=low to THRES=high (TRIG remains low)
2. Change TRIG=low to TRIG=high, resulting in TRIG=high, THRES=high)
3. Change THRES=high to THRES=low (TRIG remains high)
4. Change TRIG=high to TRIG=low, resulting in TRIG=low, THRES=low

The results from this are:

 TRIG | THRES | LED state
:----:|:-----:|:---------:
 low  | low   | on
 low  | high  | on
 high | high  | off
 high | low   | off

However, _reversing_ this cycle winds up giving different results.  Again
starting with TRIG=low and THRES=low,

1. Change TRIG=high to TRIG=low, resulting in TRIG=low, THRES=low
2. Change THRES=high to THRES=low (TRIG remains high)
3. Change TRIG=low to TRIG=high, resulting in TRIG=high, THRES=high)
4. Change THRES=low to THRES=high (TRIG remains low)

The following table shows the results from this reversed cycle, with differences
highlighted in **bold**:

 TRIG | THRES | LED state
:----:|:-----:|:---------:
 low  | low   | on
 low  | high  | **off**
 high | high  | off
 high | low   | **on**

From this, we know that when both TRIG and THRES are the same, OUT has a
deterministic state; OUT is high when TRIG=THRES=low, and OUT is low when
TRIG=THRES=high.  However, the state of OUT when TRIG != THRES depends on the
previous state of OUT.

### Astable Mode

One last way to configure TRIG and THRES is to couple them both to our variable
input so that we are changing the voltage to both input pins at the same time.
The result is quite interesting:

<div class="shortcode">
{{< figure

    alt="Varying both TRIG and THRES concurrently"
    caption="Varying both TRIG and THRES concurrently"
    >}}
</div>

(needs work)

This mode of operation is well-documented as the [**astable mode** of operation
for a 555 circuit][astable mode], and you can find a lot of documentation about how this is
used practically.  Rather than a digipot as we have used here, though, TRIG and
THRES are plugged into a resistor-capacitor series to vary the input voltage.
