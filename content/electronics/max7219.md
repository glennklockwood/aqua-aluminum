MAX7219CNG is a programmable display driver integrated circuit.  It has a bona
fide protocol, built on SPI, where you send 12-bit packet that encodes both a
4-bit command and an 8-bit value.  In this packet, the Most Significant Bits
(MSBs), or the ones that are sent first, encode the command, and the Least
Significant Bits (LSBs) encode the data.  The specific packet is constructed
such that

- bits 0-3 encode a command
- bits 4-11 encode the value that should be passed to the command

This chip has the following commands:

- Set a specific column (or "digit") of LEDs to a specific combination of on and off.  This MAX7219CNG chip supports eight columns of LEDs, so there are 8 different command codes that are used to set each of them.
- Set the "decode mode" for each column
- Set the brightness of the illuminated LEDs
- Enable or disable entire columns
- Enable or disable "shutdown mode," where all LEDs are turned off
- Enable or disable "test mode," where all LEDs are turned on at the highest brightness

The very first thing I did after soldering the components together was to enable
test mode to make sure all the LEDs did light up.  The packet we send to the
MAX7219 should look like this:

<div class="shortcode">
{{< figure src="max7219-packet.png" link="max7219-packet.png" alt="Depiction of the MAX7219 command packet" class="width-100" >}}
</div>

where the `1111` command code corresponds with test mode, and the `00000001`
value means enable.  Python has a really easy way of encoding these bits into
variables that don't require bit shift operators:

<div class="shortcode">
{{< highlight python >}}
cmd = int("1111", 2)
value = int("0000001", 2)
packet = cmd | value
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>

Alternatively, you can just encode the whole packet directly:

<div class="shortcode">
{{< highlight python >}}
packet = int("11110000001", 2)
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>

Then sending these bits down the MOSI pin will enable test mode, and all 64
LEDs should turn on at the highest brightness.  To disable test mode, send the
same command (`1111`) but a zero value (`00000000`), or

<div class="shortcode">
{{< highlight python >}}
packet = int("111100000000", 2)
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>

This test mode also overrides the values of the other settings, so it should
illuminate all LEDs at full brightness no matter what.  If any LEDs are
flickering, dim, or unlit, there is a physical problem with either the LED
(i.e., it is damaged) or a solder joint somewhere.

## Initializing the MAX7219CNG

It's a bit misleading to refer to the 4-bit command codes as such; they're
actually register addresses, and the 12-bit packets we send actually program
(write to) these special-purpose registers.  I mention this now because the
contents of these registers at any given time determine how the LEDs are
illuminated; it follows that you need to be sure you know the contents of
those registers when your program first starts.  Since there is no way to read
the contents of these registers off of the MAX7219CNG (because there is no
MISO pin), this means explicitly setting all of the registers.

So, let's first zero out all registers:

<div class="shortcode">
{{< highlight python >}}
# range(16) because there are 16 command registers, 0000 through 1111
for cmd in range(16):
    packet = cmd << 8
    # e.g., if cmd is 0101, 0101 << 8 becomes 010100000000
    spi.put(packet,12)
{{< /highlight >}}
</div>

Then there are two specific registers that must have nonzero values for all
LEDs to work correctly:

1. The scan limit register (`1011`) must have its three least significant bits
   set to 1, so the packet should be `101100000111`.  This register provides a
   way to disable columns of LEDs, so by setting it to 111 (i.e., 8), we are
   enabling all eight columns.
2. The shutdown register (`1100`) must be set to 1, so the packet should be
   `110000000001`.  When set to 0, this register shuts off all of the LEDs but
   doesn't forget their on/off state.  Thus, when you set this register, the
   LEDs light back up just as you had them before shutting down.

Once the MAX7219 is initialized, we can set LED patterns.

## Programming the MAX7219

The MAX2719 chip divides a set of 64 LEDs into eight columns ("digits") of eight
LEDs each.  The columns are numbered 1 through 8, and each LED within a column
is represented by a single bit in that column's register.
