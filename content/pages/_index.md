I am a principal engineer at Microsoft where I bring a workload-centric view
to systems design for the [largest AI supercomputers being built in Azure][azurehpc].
Prior to working at Microsoft, I was a systems architect at the [National
Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)][nersc] where I focused on
storage and data. More information about my current and past work can be
found on [Google Scholar][] and in my [biography][].

This site contains my notes in technical computing from over the years. Older
notes and blog posts are linked below, but I have started moving my personal
notes to my **[digital garden](/garden/)** which I update continuously.
