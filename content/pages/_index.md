I design storage infrastructure for high-performance computing applications in
Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform.  Prior to working at Microsoft, I was a
systems architect at the [National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center
(NERSC)][nersc] at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory][lbnl] where I helped
define long-term storage strategy, designed a 35 PB NVMe Lustre file system,
and managed the team responsible for hundreds of petabytes of disk and tape.

I worked in the genomics industry previous to that, and my formal education is
in ceramic engineering.  More information about my current and past work can
be found on [LinkedIn][] and [Google Scholar][], and excruciating details about
my life are in my [biography][].

This site contains various notes I've taken related to technical computing over
the years.  I welcome any feedback about its contents at the e-mail address
listed at the bottom of every page.  You can also find me [on Twitter][] and in
the `#hpc` channel on [Libera][].
