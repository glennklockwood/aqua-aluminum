I am a principal engineer at Microsoft where I am responsible for bringing a
workload-centric view to systems design for the largest AI supercomputers
being built in Azure. Prior to working at Microsoft, I was a systems architect
at the [National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)][nersc] at
[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory][lbnl] where I helped define [long-term
storage strategy][s2020], [designed a 35 PB NVMe Lustre file
system][n9scratchnp], and managed the team responsible for [hundreds of
petabytes of disk and tape][hpciodc20talk].

I worked in the [genomics industry][] previous to that, and my formal education
is in ceramic engineering.  More information about my current and past work can
be found on [LinkedIn][] and [Google Scholar][], and excruciating details about
my life are in my [biography][].

This site contains various notes I've taken related to technical
computing over the years. Long-form notes and how-to guides are linked directly
below, and I have begun maintaining short-form notes in my [own personal
knowledgebase](/garden/).

I welcome any feedback about its contents at the e-mail address
listed at the bottom of every page.  You can also find me
on [Twitter][twitter],
HPC.social ([chat][hpc.social chat] and [Mastodon][]),
and in the `#hpc` channel on [Libera][].
