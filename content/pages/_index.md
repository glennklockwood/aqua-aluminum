I am a computational scientist and specialist in high-performance computing
systems currently working at the [National Energy
Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)][nersc] at
[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory][lbnl].  My work
focuses on I/O performance analysis, extreme-scale storage architectures, and
emerging I/O technologies and interfaces.

In my previous life, I did research in computational materials science and
studied the chemical physics of water/silica interfaces with molecular dynamics
simulation.  I also spent some time working in the DNA sequencing industry
helping to connect bioinformaticians with the computational resources their
work demanded.  More information about me is available on [my CV][] and on
[LinkedIn][].

This site contains various notes I've taken related to technical computing
over the years.  I welcome any feedback about its contents at the e-mail
address listed at the bottom of every page, and I can also be found in
`#hpc` on [freenode][].
