I am a high-performance computing systems architect at the [National
Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)][nersc] at [Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory][lbnl].  NERSC provides high-performance computing
resources for thousands of researchers around the world each year, and my role
is to ensure that our storage systems balance advanced technologies with
production reliability to enable science that can be done nowhere else.  To this
end, my work focuses on I/O performance analysis, extreme-scale storage
architectures, and emerging I/O technologies and interfaces.

I have worked in the genomics industry in the past, and my formal education is
in ceramic engineering.  More information about my current and past work can
be found in [my CV][] and on [LinkedIn][], and excruciating details about my
life are in my [biography][].

This site contains various notes I've taken related to technical computing over
the years.  I welcome any feedback about its contents at the e-mail address
listed at the bottom of every page.  You can also find me [on Twitter][] and in
the `#hpc` channel on [freenode][].
