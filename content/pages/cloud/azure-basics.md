title: Azure Basics
---

I'm still figuring out techniques and best practices for using Azure coming from
a background in HPC.  Due to its origins in Windows, a lot of the documentation
takes a Windows/Powershell-first approach which does not compute for me.

So far I'm converging on using a combination of [Azure CLI][] and [Bicep][] as
the foundational tools for standing up infrastructure in Azure.  Look for more
notes to appear here in the future.

[Azure CLI]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/
[Bicep]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview
