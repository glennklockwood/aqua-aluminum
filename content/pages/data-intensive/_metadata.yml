title: Data-Intensive Computing
content: |
    Data-intensive computing has emerged as an area of intense interest in
    high-performance computing as the rate at which data is now being produced
    and stored is outstripping our ability to analyze it. By definition,
    these problems cannot be treated with the same means used to tackle
    traditional problems in modeling and simulation, and a set of tools is
    emerging to fill this gap.
    
    These tools, while not necessarily new, are new to the field of
    high-performance computing, and conversely, many of the concepts common to
    high-performance computing are new to the statisticians and computer
    scientists who have traditionally used these data-oriented tools.
