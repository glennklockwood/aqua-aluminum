  These materials were generated in conjunction with a set of tutorials I did
  while working as a user services consultant at the San Diego Supercomputer
  Center.  After 2014, I stopped using and supporting R for data analysis, so
  this tutorial may be very out of date.  I've been using the Python ecosystem
  as of late and recommend it since the skills you'll develop have utility in
  a broader variety of programming tasks.
