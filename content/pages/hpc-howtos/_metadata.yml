contentHtml: |
    <p>In the past I have worked as both a user services consultant and a systems
    engineer.  This section contains a few notes relevant to using and managing
    HPC resources, but the bulk of <a href="http://users.sdsc.edu/~glockwood/">my
    HPC how-to guides</a> remains hosted at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.</p>
