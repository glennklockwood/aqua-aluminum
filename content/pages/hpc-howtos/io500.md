title: Building and Running IO500
---

## Compiling

Step 1. Edit `Makefile` in the top level directory and edit `CC` and `CFLAGS` to
match the compiler and build parameters required

If you don't do this, you will get this error:

    mpicc -std=gnu99 -Wall -Wempty-body -Werror -Wstrict-prototypes -Werror=maybe-uninitialized -Warray-bounds -g3 -lefence -I./include/ -I./src/ -I./build/pfind/src/ -I./build/ior/src/ -DVERSION="\"io500-sc20_v3-6-gd25ea80d54c7\"" -c -o verifier.o src/verifier.c
    /bin/sh: mpicc: command not found
    make: *** [Makefile:59: verifier.o] Error 127

Step 2. Run `./prepare.sh` with `CC=` defined in the environment to match what
you put in the Makefile above:

    CC=cc ./prepare.sh

If you don't do this, you will get this error:

    Building parallel find;
    Using LZ4 for optimization
    ./compile.sh: line 22: mpicc: command not found

Edit `./prepare.sh` itself and edit the `build_ior` and related build functions
if needed.

## Running

The benchmark benchmarks the directory in which the `io500` binary was launched,
so `cd` into whatever file system you want to test.  Then do something like

    srun -N 4 \
         -n 64 \
         --qos regular \
         -C haswell \
         -t 30:00 \
         ./io500 config-minimal.ini

Alternatively submit it in batch mode, since it does run for a while (each test
runs for five minutes).  Here is an example of running against DataWarp:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#SBATCH -N 4
#SBATCH -n 64
#SBATCH --qos regular
#SBATCH -C haswell
#SBATCH -t 30:00
#DW jobdw type=scratch access_mode=striped capacity=10TiB

cd $DW_JOB_STRIPED
srun "$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/io500" "$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/config-minimal.ini"
```

Notes about the way the io500 binary works:

- It automatically scales the benchmark to match the nprocs it's given, and it
  runs in whatever `$PWD` is.  So it inherits a lot from the execution
  environment.
- It uses stonewalling by default, so some of the input parameters may seem
  ridiculously large.  For example IOR easy is configured to write over 9 TB by
  default.
