## Introduction

Alumina, or aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is one of the most
academically studied ceramics in ceramic science due to its ease of
manufacturing, resistance to corrosion, creep, and sagging, low cost, and
high-temperature refractory nature.  It is the most widely used ceramic
electronic substrate, and is commonly found in milling media, spark plugs, and
wear-resistant applications such as pump seals and welding nozzles.

## Classifications of Alumina

There are many different forms into which alumina occurs and can be
synthesized.  Of particular interest are:

- **Corundum** - Single crystal alumina that occurs naturally in the form of
  sapphire or, when a small amount of chromium oxide is included in the
  crystal, ruby.  Single crystal alumina can also be made by drawing crystals
  from a melt.
- **Large-grained alumina** - Alumina with grains up to 100-200 microns in
  size.  Typically used for its great creep resistance, and ranges in color
  from white (due to its large band gap) to an array of colors dependent on
  any sintering aids or colorants added.
- **Small-grained alumina** - Used in applications that demands high strength.
- **High-purity alumina** - Used for its corrosion resistance, as acids tend
  to attack impurities which may accumulate at grain boundaries.
- **Low-alkali alumina** - Common for electronic applications.
- **Coarser-grained alumina** is often a raw material in the reduction of
  aluminum metal (metallization).

Alumina also has a number of phases, possibly the most proliferous being the
&alpha; phase.  Almost all sintered, densified alumina is this alpha phase,
which forms hexagonal close-packed structures in which aluminum ions fill
two-thirds of the octahedral sites due to their small ionic radii (roughly 0.5
&Aring;).

The &gamma; phase is a very fine-grained alumina that occurs in a cubic spinel
structure but converts readily to the &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in
sintering temperatures (specifically, &gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
inverts at 1150&deg;C), making it very difficult to impossible to sinter into a
dense body.  However, gamma powder has a very high specific surface area of
about 100 square meters per gram, while by comparison,
&alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has about 5 square meters per gram. 
This dramatic difference illustrates how quickly alumina grains coarsen when
they undergo the transformation &gamma;- to &alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
phase at 1150&deg;C.  The phase transformation is also an exothermic one (Q=20
to 40 kJ/mol), which drives up the temperature of the system, resulting in
coarsening and further phase transformation which perpetuates and makes
temperature stabilization in this transformation regime very difficult.

Beta "phases" of alumina also exist, but are actually alumina with the
incorporation of sodium ions in the lattice.  Particularly, &beta;-alumina
is Na<sub>2</sub>O&middot;11Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the &beta;&Prime;
phase is Na<sub>2</sub>O&middot;5Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.  These high
concentrations of sodium are common artifacts of the Bayer process which uses
caustic soda as a reaction precursor and contribute to ionic conductivity of
these aluminas.  Thus, they are good electrode materials for batteries and can
also be used as a solid electrolyte for load-leveling batteries.

## Sintering Alumina

Various additives are added to alumina to promote high densification.  Talc
may be added to promote the formation of a liquid phase, with a particularly
ideal additive being the silica-rich eutectic composition in the
MgO-SiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system.  However, it is
important to note that the amount of this liquid phase is dynamic, so the
sintering rates (which show Arrhenius behavior) are also dynamic and depend on
the relative amount of liquid phase present.

MgO added in quantities between 300 and 500 ppm act as inhibitors of grain
growth during alumina sintering which can reduce the relative rate of
coarsening to densification.  Reducing grain boundary mobility during
sintering also greatly reduces the occurrence of pores becoming entrapped
within grains due to effects related to pore drag.  While this small addition
of MgO significantly inhibits grain boundary movement (by a factor of 35), it
also slightly increases pore mobility at the grain boundary, allowing them to
diffuse to the surface faster.  Without MgO, though, a typical alumina sample
will have grains between 50 and 60 microns and considerable intragranular
porosity; for example, Alcoa A16G has a starting size of 400 nanometers which
grow to 40 microns during sintering.

High densification in sintering also can be achieved by eliminating
&gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> from the starting powder.  Because
&gamma;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is water soluble, it will dissolve and
reprecipitate at particle necks, causing coarsening without densification.  It
also promotes the formation of agglomerates which inhibit the efficient
pressing of green bodies.  Of course, the normal problems associated with the
sintering of gamma alumina also work against the densification of
&alpha;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> if present, namely, runaway coarsening due
to the exothermic phase transformation.

Other sintering additives include CuO or TiO<sub>2</sub> and work by causing
more vacancies in the alumina lattice.  These vacancies promote diffusivity
and increase diffusion rates; however, they produce dark coloration to the
final ceramic.
