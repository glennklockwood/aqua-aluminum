## Introduction

All metals can be classified into the two broad groups of ferrous and
nonferrous metals, ferrous metals being ones that contain iron.  Iron is the
basis of such classification because of it proliferance; it is a very cheap
metal that is easy to refine yet is tremendously versatile due to the many
different phases and properties it can have by itself or when combined with
carbon or other alloying metals.  This document discusses primarily the
engineering aspect of metallurgy.

## Ferrous Alloys

Metals containing iron as a primary constituent can be subdivided into two
general groups including steels and cast irons.  Of course, these subdivisions
can be further split into many classifications still.  Of all steels, the
primary classifications are:

- **low carbon steels**, which contain less than 0.25wt% carbon (hypoeutectoid)
- **medium carbon steels** which contain between 0.25% and 0.6% carbon (again, hypoeutectoid)
- **high carbon steels** which contain between 0.6% and 1.4% carbon (hypoeutectoid, eutectoid, or hypereutectoid)

The Society of Automotive Engineers has a classification splits hairs with
these classifications, specifying a numbering system for various steels of the
form XXYY, where XX represents the alloying metals in the steel and YY
represents hundreths of a weight percent carbon in the alloy.  For example, a
<span style="color:red">10</span><span style="color:blue">25</span> steel would
contain 0.<span style="color:blue">25</span>% carbon and no alloying agents
(identified by the <span style="color:red">10</span>).  Common metals included
in steel include:

SAE Grade | Contents
:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------
10YY      | plain steel with 0.YY wt% carbon
11YY      | resulfurized steel (for machineability)
15YY      | Manganese 10-20%
40YY      | Molybdenum 0.2-0.3%
43YY      | Nickel (1.65-2%) + Chromium (0.4-0.9%) + Molybdenum (0.2-0.3%)
44YY      | Molybdenum 0.5%

Going back to the classifications of low, medium, and high-carbon steels, here
are some examples of applications and compositions/alloys of these steels:

Plain Steel | High Strength, Low Alloy (HSLA) | Plain Steel | Heat Treatable | Plain Steel | Tool Steel | Stainless Steel

As more carbon is added to steels, the alloy enters the _cast iron_ regime,
where there is between 3% and 4.5% carbon by weight.  These cast irons are
often combined with elemental silicon in order to decompose the cementite (iron
carbide, Fe<sub>3</sub>C) phase and therefore the pearlite phase into iron and
graphite.  The advantage of these cast irons are that they are cheap, hard,
brittle, and as its name implies, easy to pour.  They find their uses in
applications such as cast-iron engine blocks and such, and can be broken down
into several categories:

- **Gray cast** iron is formed upon slow cooling of a silicon-rich cast iron
  and is characterized by the occurrence of graphite flakes in the structure
  which add as stress concentrators.  These produce favorable vibrational
  dampening and wear resistance at the expensive of strength and ductility;
  while the tensile stress is weak, grey cast irons still possess fair
  compressive strength.
- **Ductile cast iron** is made when magnesium or cerium is added to
  spheroidite, a product of annealing pearlitic iron.  Ductile iron, as its
  name implies, is soft and ductile because of these additions.
- **White cast iron** contains less than 1% silicon which results in more
  residual cementite (Fe<sub>3</sub>C), increasing hardness at the expense of
  ductility.
- **Malleable cast iron** is the product of annealing white cast iron at
  between 800&deg;C and 900&deg;C and is characterized by graphite rosettes
  within the metal.  Malleable cast iron is more ductile than white cast iron.

## Nonferrous Alloys

Nonferrous alloys vary more widely in their primary metallic constituent and
therefore have a wide range of properties.

### Copper Alloys

Metals based around copper carry significant engineering interest.  Copper takes
a face-centered cubic structure in a pure state and is therefore very ductile.
Copper is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor, and it possesses
moderate resistance to corrosion.

The addition of zinc produces brass which is even more resistant to corrosion
and may take either the &alpha; phase (which is face-centered cubic and ductile)
or &beta;&prime; phase (body-centered cubic and harder).  The addition of tin
to copper produces bronze which often also contains aluminum, nickel, zinc,
and/or silicon, which is a stronger than pure copper.

### Aluminum Alloys

Aluminum is also the base for many alloys and takes an FCC structure while
unalloyed.  Aluminum alloys are remarkably lightweight due to aluminum's
density of 2.7 g/cc (compared to the 7.9 g/cc density of steel or 4.0 g/cc
of alumina) and has very good resistance to corrosion and oxidation due to its
self-passivation.  Aluminum is often strengthened with the addition of alloying
metals.

### Other Structural Alloys

Some less-common alloys include those based from magnesium, which has become
popular as a material for bicycle frames due to its extremely low density (1.7
g/cc) and rigidity due to its hexagonal close-packed structure.  Titanium
alloys are more dense than these lightweight alloys (titanium's density is
4.5g/cc), but are very strong and have remarkable strength to weight ratios.

### Refractory Alloys

Many metals possess strong metallic bonding and strong elastic moduli which,
along with their low thermal expansion, make exceptional in high-temperature
applications.  Common refractory metals include

- **Tungsten (W)**, which melts at around 3400&deg;C
- **Tantalum (Ta)**, which melts at around 3000&deg;C
- **Molybdenum (Mo)**, which melts at around 2600&deg;C
- **Niobium (Nb)**, which melts at around 2400&deg;C

To put things into perspective, pure iron melts at around 1500&deg;C, and 
the surface of the sun is around 6000&deg;C.  Thus, these refractory metals
have melting points that exceed those of steels by twofold or more.

### Superalloys

Superalloys are nickel, cobalt, or iron-based alloys that are used in
environments that demand extremely low creep and high resistance to oxidation at
temperatures exceeding 1000&deg;C.  For example, almost all high-end gas
turbine blades (i.e., the insides of jet engines) are single crystal
nickel-based superalloy blades coated with a zirconia thermal (plasma) spray.
They operate at extremely high temperatures and are subject to extremely high
stresses, so exceptional creep resistance is required to prevent the turbine
blades from deforming during operation.

### Noble Metals

Noble metals are also of interest due to their rarity in nature (which makes
them appealing to jewelers) and inertness in many chemically reactive
environments (which makes them appealing to material scientists).  These
metals include gold, silver, platinum, iridium, osmium, rhenium, and palladium,
and they all resist oxidation.

## Metal Processing

Transforming metal stock into a useful shape is generally done by either
forming, casting, or joining, and postforming processes such as hardening may
be required to fully tailor a metal's properties to a specific applications.
Rather than discuss each method of shaping metal, below is a brief explanation
of the various terms that are common in metalworking.

- Metal forming
    - **Hot forging** involves stamping a piece of hot metal into a die to shape it.  Cold forging is similar, sans the hot part.
    - **Drawing** is used to make tubes and wires and involves pulling hot metal through a die or orifice.
    - **Extrusion** is similar to drawing, except pressure is used to force the metal through a die or orifice.
    - **Rolling** is when metal (such as in the form of an ingot) is squeezed through two rollers.  Like forging, this can be hot or cold.
- Metal casting
    - **Sand casting** involves pouring liquid metal into a sand mold and then breaking away the sand after cooling; this is used in the molding of engine blocks and large parts due to its relatively low cost.
    - **Investment casting** is the casting of liquid metal into refractory plaster molds which are formed around wax models.
    - **Die casting** uses a two-piece refractory die to mass produce high volume pieces.
    - **Continuous casting** is used for simple objects such as ingots and, as the name implies, is a continuous process.
- Metal Joining
    - **Powder metallurgy** is much like ceramic powder processing where a compact of metal powder is sintered into a dense body.
    - **Powder forging** is much like hot forging, except instead a collection of powder is stamped under enough stress to cause fusion of the particulates.
    - **Welding** is used to join large pieces of metal and often causes localized microstructural changes due to the intense heat conducted to the regions around the weld

Another important concept to recognize are the hardening phenomena that occur
in alloys which is at the core of why alloying is such a useful process.
Because metals yield by the movement of dislocations through their lattice,
inhibiting dislocation movement hardens metals and makes them less ductile.
Solid solution hardening occurs because alloyed atoms in the primary metal's
crystalline structure induce stresses in the lattice; these localized
tension/compression zones set up regions where large and small atoms prefer to
move, respectively.  Thus, as a dislocation migrates through a such region,
the dislocation has to either overcome this natural inclination for atoms to
stay in these preferred location or drag these stressed locations along with it.

A related phenomenon called precipitation hardening occurs when an alloy is
cooled below its limit of solid solution stability and a second phase begins
to precipitate out.  By controlling how long the metal is held in this
two-phase region, the size of these second phase nucleii can be controlled,
thereby allowing for relatively precise control over the hardening of the alloy.
