title: Molecular Dynamics Tutorial
content: |
    I wrote this tutorial while I was a graduate student at the [Interfacial
    Molecular Science Laboratory (IMSL)](http://glass.rutgers.edu) for the
    undergraduate interns who would join our lab.  Their internship was often their
    first exposure to simulation techniques or even UNIX/Linux systems, so these
    material assume zero working knowledge of technical computing.

    The tutorial material is highly specific to the software and computing
    environment we had at the lab, but some budding materials science researcher
    may find the introduction interesting nonetheless.  This tutorial could also
    be easily converted to use an open-source MD code such as [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/);
    all the same principles would apply even though the syntax is different.

    What follows below and in subsequent pages are the tutorial materials as they
    were written in 2012.

    This tutorial is aimed to equip the new researcher with the basics of working
    with the molecular dynamics code and related research tools used at the
    Interfacial Molecular Science Laboratory at Rutgers.  It is a general procedure
    that has been put to new students for decades and provides hands-on experience
    in configuring and running molecular dynamics simulations.
