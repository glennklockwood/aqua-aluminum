## Introduction

Silicon carbide, SiC, is a very hard and strong non-oxide ceramic that
possesses unique thermal and electronic properties.  With strengths ranging
from 15 GPa in polycrystalline bodies up to 27 GPa in SiC single crystals and
its excellent creep resistance, silicon carbide also lends itself to many
high-temperature mechanical applications.  Although it oxidizes in air at
above 1600&deg;C, silicon carbide's upper limit of stability is around
2500&deg;C and has a melting temperature of around 2830&deg;C, and its
peculiarly good thermal conductivity (comparable to that of copper) make it a
very useful material for use as heating elements in furnaces.

In addition, SiC has a narrow band gap (2.2 eV in &alpha;-SiC and 3.3 in
&beta;-SiC) which makes it valuable as a low-temperature semiconductor.  In
fact, silicon carbide so readily surrenders electrons at elevated temperatures,
it shows behavior consistent with metallic conductors after a certain
temperature limit.

## Structure and Phases 

Silicon carbide, due to the close proximity of silicon and carbide on the
periodic table, is a highly covalent material that forms tetrahedra that are
centered around either carbon or silicon atoms.  These tetrahedra form a
close-packed structure with half of the tetrahedral sites filled, and occur
primarily in the &alpha;-SiC and &beta;-SiC phases.

&beta;-SiC takes the diamond cubic structure with half of the carbons being
replaced with silicon; this is a very stable structure that is conducive to
phononic heat conduction.  For example, diamond, beryllia, and aluminum
nitride all take this structure and have good to excellent thermal
conductivity.  The similarity in atomic radii also contribute to this good
conductivity, as disproportionate atoms in a lattice tend to cause phonons to
scatter more readily.

&alpha;-SiC is the more common form of silicon nitride and occurs in a
hexagonal close-packed structure with the SiC tetrahedra half-filled.  This is
the form of SiC that is used in polishing paper and grinding media and is
produced by the &beta;-&alpha; phase transformation that occurs between
1500&deg;C to 1600&deg;C.  However, the &alpha;-SiC is also highly irregular
in that it possesses crystallographic faults every four to six lattice spacings.

## Synthesis

The _Acheson process_ is the most prevalent method of producing silicon carbide
in massive quantities and involves running huge currents through enormous
tanks of silica sand and carbon logs (coke).  The silicon and carbon react at
high temperature to produce &alpha;-SiC and carbon monoxide according to
the very simple reaction

This method is very energy intensive and generally is powered by hydroelectric
sources.  Other methods of synthesizing silicon carbide include gas-phase
synthesis or vapor deposition processes.

## Densification

Unfortunately, this silicon carbide powder is difficult to sinter due to the
low diffusion coefficients inherent in the material.  Regular sintering
conditions usually result in large amounts of neck growth without
densification, a process exacerbated by the volatization of SiO<sub>2</sub>
to SiO + O<sub>2</sub> which condenses at the neck region between particles.
Thus, several methods of densifying SiC have been developed.

Probably the cheapest dense silicon carbide is clay-bonded SiC which is simply
SiC powder combined with 10-50% clay and fired.  The clay inhibits
evaporation/condensation of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and it turns out that this
combination produces a refractory with very good thermal shock resistance.

Another method is by reaction bonding silicon carbide; this process entails
mixing SiC powder with a binder which is carburized when heated in a reducing
furnace.  This SiC-carbon body is then infiltrated with liquid silicon which
reacts and produces a dense mass of silicon carbide.  The only downfall to this
process is the presence of excess silicon that may be left unreacted.

Nitride-bonded silicon carbide is made by dispersing fine silicon powder in a
compact of larger silicon carbide particles and sintering in a nitrogen
furnace; this produces a predominantly silicon carbide structure with a large
percentage of its porosity filled with silicon nitride.  Of course, the
addition of sintering aids works as well too, with 0.5% carbon and 0.5% boron
being a popular combination.  This enhances densification significantly
because the carbon reacts with surficial SiO<sub>2</sub> to prevent the
SiO<sub>2</sub> to SiO condensation/evaporation while the boron is theorized
to eliminate surface diffusion and modify grain boundary energy to make the
dihedral angle conducive to pore shrinkage.

## Applications

Silicon carbide is used as a semiconductor replacement for silicon in many
high-powered applications because of its high temperature capabilities, high
frequency abilities, and good switching speed.  However, SiC also has found
use in ballistic armoring in the form of fiber reinforcers or wet/dry-milled
silicon carbide combined with aluminum nitride.
