## Introduction

One of several non-oxide synthetic advanced ceramics, silicon nitride
(Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) is valued for its excellent resistance to
thermal shock and its high temperature strength.  In fact, it was these
properties that made silicon nitride a promising material for use as ceramic
engines in the energy crisis of the 1970s.  Its high temperature strength and
resistance to thermal shock lended it to being possible of producing an engine
that could be run at temperatures that exceed the limits of metal-based
internal combustion engines, thereby increasing its efficiency.

Unfortunately, silicon nitride's $200 per kilogram price tag and catastrophic
failure mechanism resulted in this research being a dead end.  However, it is
still a very interesting and important ceramic today.

## Synthesis

There are a number of ways to produce silicon nitride.  From a purely chemical
standpoint, these reactions are the primary means of synthesizing Si3N4:

1. 3Si + 2N<sub>2</sub> = Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>
2. 3SiO<sub>2</sub> + 6C + 2N<sub>2</sub> = Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> + 6CO
3. 3SiO(g) + 3CO + 2N<sub>2</sub> = Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> + 3CO<sub>2</sub>
4. SiCl<sub>4</sub>(l) + 6NH<sub>3</sub> = SiNH<sub>2</sub> + 4NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
5. SiNH<sub>2</sub> = Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>

There are two common phases of silicon nitride, the &alpha; and &beta; phases.
&alpha;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is oxygen rich, so much so that it was
long thought to be a two-phase composite material.  &beta;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>
is generally fibrous in morphology compared to the uniaxed
&alpha;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> phase, and is often transformed from
&alpha;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> into needles during the sintering process.
However, pure &beta;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> does not sinter well and
produces little to no grain growth and finds much more practical use as a
fiber reinforcer in composites.

## Properties

As previously mentioned, silicon nitride has thermal shock resistance superior
to many other ceramics.  Thermal shock resistance is a function of a material's
fracture strength (&sigma;), thermal conductivity (K), Young's modulus (E), and
thermal expansivity (&alpha;).  While silicon nitride's mechanical properties
are comparable to other advanced ceramics, its thermal expansivity
(3 &middot; 10<sup>-6</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>) is superior to that of silicon
carbide (4 &middot; 10<sup>-6</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>), another advanced ceramic
noted for its good thermal properties.

Silicon nitride's maximum operating temperature is governed by several
reactions it undergoes at high temperatures (around 1900&deg;C), particularly

and

Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> + 3SiO<sub>2</sub> = 6SiO(g) + 2N<sub>2</sub>
</p>

The first reaction is simply the breakdown point of silicon nitride while the
second reaction is an interaction between silicon nitride and its passivating
silica layer which results in the volatization of solid material.  However,
the same passivating silica layer is what provides silicon nitride with its
stability at room temperature; Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is thermodynamically
unstable in the presence of oxygen due to silicon's preference to be
SiO<sub>2</sub>.  The passivating SiO<sub>2</sub> layer provides a kinetic
barrier to oxidation of subsurface material, though, and results in silicon
nitride's metastability.

An even better kinetic barrier may arise from the passivating layer's
interaction with the silicon nitride below, producing a
Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O layer through which is harder still for oxygen to
diffuse.

## Densification

Because silicon nitride tends to react with its passivating SiO<sub>2</sub>
layer and preferentially undergo evaporation/condensation under sintering
conditions, several interesting techniques have been developed in order to
produce dense silicon nitride bodies.  Reaction bonded silicon nitride
involvings pressing pure silicon powder into a desired shape and firing it in
a nitrogen furnace to induce the reaction between silicon and nitrogen.

The transformation of Si to Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> is accompanied by a 22%
volume increase, but this expansion is entirely into the body; that is, the
surface silicon is nitrided first, creating a rigid shell that inhibits
expansion.  As the nitrogen infiltrates the pores between the silicon powder
particles and reacts, the expansion of the silicon to silicon nitride
transformation occurs at interparticle necks and pores, ultimately producing a
body with up to 85% theoretical density. 

This 15%+ porosity is due to the gas/solid nature of the reaction; without this
porosity, internal regions would never be nitrided and would remain as a
silicon core.  It is also important to note that this process occurs near the
melting point of silicon, and the nitridization reaction is exothermic.  Thus,
in order to prevent runaway heating and melting of the sample during the
process, special furnaces that dynamically control the temperature ramp by
gauging nitrogen consumption rates must be used.  However, all of this effort
results in a strongly bonded silicon nitride structure with fairly good creep
resistance despite the porosity.

Hot pressing silicon nitride green bodies is another method of densifying
bodies with simple geometry.  MgO may be added to the silicon nitride to form
an intermediate viscious liquid phase which promotes full density of the
compact, and a combination of 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and 5%
Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can also be used to form a fluid glassy phase which
fills grain boundaries.  While this glassy phase greatly reduces the creep
resistance of the resulting ceramics, it is the lesser of two evils in many
applications that value a denser structure.

The addition of 3% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and 8% Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
also is used in the pressureless sintering of silicon nitride.  By sintering
under these reduced pressures, more liquid phase forms in the compact to help
sintering.  By starting with &alpha;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> with not more
than 5% &beta;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> present, the Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
liquid can act as a solvent which dissolves the &alpha; phase and
recrystallizes it as &beta; phase on the &beta;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>
seeds.

After the &alpha; phase is fully consumed, the result is a dense, body that
possesses a glassy phase at the grain boundary but is intrinsically toughened
by crack-bridging &beta;-Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> fibers; these have
K<sub>IC</sub> values 2x - 3x greater than that of regular silicon nitride.
Other additives to increase the strength of silicon nitride include
Lu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
