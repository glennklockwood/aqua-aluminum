## Introduction

Of all the metal oxide ceramics, the most thermodynamically stable (as can be
seen on an Ellingham diagram) include lithia, lime, alumina, and zirconia;
however, lithia and lime are hygroscopic, and this leaves alumina and zirconia
as the most stable of the traditional ceramic oxides.  Refined primarily from
zircon (zirconium silicate), zirconia is remarkably stable and resistant to
corrosion from liquid metals.  It also has very good mechanical properties
which make it ideal for use in cutting tools, milling media, and extrusion
dies at low temperatures while having a good degree of ductility at high
temperatures.

## Thermodynamics of Zirconia

Cubic zirconia, known for its similarity to diamond as a gemstone, has a
fluorite structure where every other fluorite cell has a zirconium ion to
preserve charge balance; upon cooling to below 2369&deg;C, the structure
stretches into a tetragonal form.  However, further cooling to around
1170&deg;C results in a tetragonal to monoclinic transformation which, due to
the very different geometries of the crystals, results in a 4.5% volumetric
expansion and 12% shear in the crystal.

This phase transformation is what makes sintering pure zirconia very difficult;
sintering temperatures are generally in the tetragonal regime, and the cooling
causes the monoclinic transformation which generally shears the sample to
pieces.

Stabilization of the cubic phase came into being in the 1930s by the addition
of one of several possible aids including MgO, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CaO,
and CeO<sub>2</sub>.  By including enough of these additives into the
structure so as to avoid the monoclinic phase field, the slow kinetics of the
phase transformations can be used to avoid monoclinic transformation by
remaining in two-phase regions.  Furthermore, in the yttria-zirconia system, a
cubic phase is stable at room temperatures beyond 8% Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

What exactly causes this stabilization?  In the case of yttria-stabilized
zirconia (YSZ), the yttrium cations are larger than the zirconium cations
(1.019 &Aring; versus 0.84 &Aring; according to [Shannon 1976][Shannon 1976])
and prevent the crystal from collapsing to a monoclinic structure.  The yttria
provides a kinetic barrier that inhibits the phase transformation, as the
cubic to tetragonal transformation requires that yttria diffuse out of the
regions where the tetragonal phase is to form (since the cubic phase is more
yttria-rich than the tetragonal).  Since this diffusion of yttria must precede
the formation of the tetragonal phase, cooling fast enough to prevent the
diffusion from occurring results in tetragonal ZrO<sub>2</sub>.

## Transformation Toughening

Moderate cooling rates of YSZ result in limited nucleation of tetragonal
zirconia in a cubic zirconia matrix.  At room temperature, this tetragonal
phase would readily transform into the monoclinic process via a diffusionless
martensitic transformation, but the volumetric expansion associated with this
transformation would require these tetragonal regions to perform work on the
cubic matrix.  The energy demands of this transformation are insufficient, and
thus the tetragonal phase can persist in the cubic matrix at room temperature.

However, when a crack forms and propogates through such a structure, the crack
tip opens enough space for these tetragonal regions to expand and invert to the
monoclinic phase.  Because this transformation is martensitic, it occurs at
the speed of sound and instantly closes the crack as the tetragonal phase
expands into the monoclinic--this effect significantly toughens the zirconia
by closing any cracks that form, and this is the principle by which transformation-toughened zirconia gains its improved mechanical properties.

Zirconia is an immensely important material in ceramic science due to its
various properties.  It is a principal constituent of AZS, a very important
refractory material, is of great interest as a solid-oxide fuel cell material
due to its high amount of vacancies introduced by yttria doping, and is
incorporated as a thermal coating on almost every gas turbine engine blade.
