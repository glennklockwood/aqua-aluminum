title: My old computer collection
---

When I was a graduate student, I used to collect a variety of older RISC 
workstations to play with all of the different exotic flavors of Unix that
preceded Linux.  I downsized my collection substantially when I moved to
California, so this page will be mostly a memory of what used to be.

For the time being, here is an old photo of a few of my Sun Blade workstations
with my girl Anna enjoying them.

I had a steady supply of Sun and Silicon Graphics hardware at the time, and I
cut my teeth on Solaris and IRIX as a result.
