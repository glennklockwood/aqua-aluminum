## A Biographical Narrative

I was born in Hawaii and moved to the mainland when I was quite young.  I grew
up in the suburbs of central New Jersey, just off of 8A on the turnpike.  After
completing high school, I attended the [School of Engineering at Rutgers
University][ru engineering] where I majored in ceramic engineering and spent a
year and change doing research using molecular simulation at the [Interfacial
Molecular Science Lab][imsl].  I graduated in the final class of ceramic
engineers at Rutgers; the program was replaced by one in materials science and
engineering in the following year.

Ceramic science is a fascinating one, but a field trip to a local glass factory
in my final year as an undergraduate made me realize that I really did not want
to be an engineer when I grew up.  To defer having to go out into the real world
to make a living, I opted to go to graduate school instead and enrolled in the
materials engineering program at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
My hope was to become an electron microscopist, as Lehigh had some of the 
world's most [sophisticated aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
microscopes][camn] at the time (supercomputers of the microscope world, in a
sense).

Those plans did not pan out, and after a semester in Pennsylvania, I returned to
Rutgers to continue doing research with molecular dynamics simulations.

In the four years I was doing my Ph.D. work at Rutgers, I started collecting old
UNIX workstations.  In the course of playing with them all, I began benchmarking
my molecular dynamics codes on them, and this gave me an appreciation for the
nuances and performance features of various old RISC architectures.  I had also
started getting involved in the HPC community online, and I credit my friends
(now colleagues) on IRC and Twitter with providing the inspiration and knowledge
to consider HPC as a career rather than a mere hobby.

During graduate school I also married my wife (and spent two months doing
research out of her father's tractor shop on the Canadian prairie--an
interesting experience!).  When I finally completed [my
dissertation][my dissertation], I made the decision to change careers and
pursue my interest in HPC full-time.  And, since I had also forced my wife to
live with me in [suburban New Jersey][highland park] for four years, I looked
for jobs in places that were most un-like suburban New Jersey.  Much to my
great fortune, the [San Diego Supercomputer Center][sdsc] had an open position
in user services, and I was able to trick them into thinking I knew enough
about HPC to be employable.

SDSC provided me with access to the resources, expertise, and support to develop
a strong foundation in high-performance computing, and my role in user services
put me in a position to solve challenging issues in a variety of scientific
domains.  Most notably, the next-generation sequencing industry (largely
centered in San Diego) began growing into the realm of HPC at that time, and my
understanding of the intricacies of [SDSC's exotic data-intensive
supercomputer][gordon] led me to a number of [consulting projects in
sequencing][janssen slides].

My [analyses of the computational requirements demanded by DNA
sequencing][sequencing cost blog] caught the attention of a few companies who
were technologically ahead of the curve.  I was eventually extended a unique
opportunity to join an [early-stage sequencing startup][10xtech] that was
developing a revolutionary new product, and my desire to experience the startup
life and be a part of such a rapidly growing industry lured me away from SDSC.

After eighteen months in San Diego, I moved up to Oakland and joined [10X 
Genomics][10x genomics] as a DevOps Engineer (a job which I had no idea how to
do).  My job involved running a small cluster, maintaining a couple hundred
terabytes of storage, and integrating 10X's software product with HPC
infrastructure and cutting-edge DNA sequencers.  My heart never left
supercomputing though, and shortly after my one-year anniversary at 10X, I
returned to the world of supercomputing at the [National Energy Research
Scientific Computing Center][nersc] (NERSC) at the [Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory][lbl.gov] (LBL).

Now at NERSC, I am a part of the [Advanced Technologies Group][nersc atg] where
I try to envision what the future of supercomputing will have to be to meet the
needs of scientists.
